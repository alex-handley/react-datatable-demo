# WIP react-datatable-demo

I worked on a project a while back that used Datatable but the users had the requirement of seeing all of the rows on a single page without pagination.
The performance during searching always annoyed me so I thought I would see if adding a virtual DOM would improve performance when rendering elements during searches.

## Tech Specs
- Yeoman with Grunt
- React (0.12.2)
- Datatables (1.10.0)

## Install
    npm install
    bower install
   
## Running
    grunt serve
